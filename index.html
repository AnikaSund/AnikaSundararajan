        Hi, I'm Anika and this is my website. I do many different
        activities<br> as part of and outside of school. I code, which is how I made <br>this website and I draw a lot, mostly sketching. I also enjoy <br>Leadership work, which includes Charity and I am into lots of <br>different kinds of music. Some basic information is that I am <br>currently 13 years old and started working on this site when <br>I was 12 and worked on it till I was __. I constantly go <br>back to tweak it by improving old or adding new information. <br>

        I made this website using HTML coding combined with CSS. I originally made it on Mozilla Thimble, which is an online code editor and then I transfered it onto a GitHub repository.
